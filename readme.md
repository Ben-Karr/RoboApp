## RoboApp ##
A Project to make the results of [RoboML](https://github.com/Ben-Karr/RoboMl) available in an web app.

The app is using Flask at the backend and JavaScript at the Frontend. It is deployed on Heroku at http://robocircuit.herokuapp.com .

# Status #
By now, you can (only) upload photos of electronic circuits to classify if they are running a connection from the __+__ to the __-__ pole.

# To-Do #
* Make JS functionality available on Heroku (CSP?).
* Update the used model.
* Implement Help (manual / tutorial).
* Implement Settings (choose different robotics projects / language / â€¦ ).
